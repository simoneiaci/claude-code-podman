## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of
Conduct:

1. Correction
   - Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
     unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
   - Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
     clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
     behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. Warning
   - Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of
     actions.
   - Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
     interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. This
     includes avoiding interactions in community spaces and external channels
     like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
     permanent ban.

3. Temporary Ban
   - Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including
     sustained inappropriate behavior.
   - Consequence: A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication
     with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private
     interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
     with community leaders, is allowed during this period. Violating these
     terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. Permanent Ban
   - Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
     standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
     individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of
     individuals.
   - Consequence: A permanent ban from any interaction or public communication
     with the community.
